GOGranny is based on GOGrapher, a python library that uses the Gene Ontology to 
create a network relating terms to each other and genes/proteins to terms.
GOGranny is so named to distinguish it from the previous work
of the GOGrapher team, without whom these additions would not be possible.

The prerequisites for installation are python (python.org) and 
NetworkX (networkx.lanl.gov).

To install, simply run:
$> python setup.py install
