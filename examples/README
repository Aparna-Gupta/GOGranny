README file for GOGrapher examples.

## First Step ##
THIS STEP IS NECESSARY BEFORE THE FOLLOWING EXAMPLES WILL WORK

The first thing you will likely want to do is create an example graph file.  To do this, run:
$> python makeHumanBiologicalProcess.py

This will create two files in the examples directory:
 1) human.bp.digraph.pickle - A directed version of the Human biological process graph
 2) human.bp.graph.pickle - An undirected version of the Human biological process graph



## Making Images ##
You can, if you wish, now create an image of this graph (you will need pygraphviz 
installed).  To do this, you can run:

$> python makeHumanBiologicalProcessImage.py

This might take a while to make the whole graph.  You can easily expiriment with 
mixing this script with the one that makes a Minimal Spanning Tree (MST).  The full
picture is really...full.



## Making a Minimal Spanning Tree ##
By running:
$> python makeMinimalSpanningTree.py

A minimal spanning tree (based on the random selection of 20 nodes) will be 
created and stored in an XGMML file (which can be imported into Cytoscape - 
see https://projects.dbbe.musc.edu/trac/GOGrapher/wiki/ViewingXGMMLInCytoscape
for more information).



## Making an XGMML File ##
By running:
$> python makeXGMML.py
The human directed biological process graph will be saved to an xgmml file.


## Others ##
makeProteinGraph.py will make a GOProteinGraph from the human biological
process graph and saves it as a pickle file.

weightGraph.py will weight the directed human biological process graph
using the simple weighter (adds a weight of 1 to each edge) and saves
it as a pickle file.
